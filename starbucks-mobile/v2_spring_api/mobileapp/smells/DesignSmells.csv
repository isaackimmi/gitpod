Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
main,starbucks,PinEntryMachine,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: Device; PinEntryMachine; AppController; AddCard; ScreenCenterDecorator; MyCards; MyCardsPay; ScreenLeftDecorator; Store; Settings; MyCardsOptions; Frame
main,starbucks,PinEntryMachine,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 23 public methods
main,starbucks,StarbucksAPI,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: apiurl; apikey; register; balance; cardId; cardCode
main,starbucks,Card,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: balance; cardId; cardCode
main,starbucks,Frame,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 32 public methods
main,starbucks,PinScreen,Broken Hierarchy,The tool detected a potential instance of the smell because this type does not implement or override any method from it's supertype(s): Screen
main,starbucks,Card,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
main,starbucks,Device,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: theDevice; fourPin; sixPin; pin; props; app; kp; pc4; pc6; ps; sp; authenticated; showInvalidPin; pm; screen_frame_header; portrait_screen_width; portrait_screen_length; landscape_screen_width; landscape_screen_length; device_orientation_state
main,starbucks,Device,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 33 public methods
main,starbucks,Main,Imperative Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: main
main,starbucks,Main,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
